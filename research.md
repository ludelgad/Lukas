## Job Market Paper

- [Immigration and Worker Responses Across Firms: Evidence from Administrative Records in Colombia]()
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary> <p> 
  This paper studies the worker-level effects of a labor supply shock and the role of firms in these effects. To do so, I exploit the mass arrival of migrants from Venezuela in Colombia and use administrative employer-employee data covering the universe of formal workers to follow natives' labor market outcomes over time. First, I find a reduction in employment concentrated at the bottom of the wage distribution (among self-employed and minimum-wage earners) and in low-paying firms. Besides, I find a negative wage effect driven by workers from the upper part of the wage distribution who work in small firms. Consistent with this, I construct a model of heterogeneous firms to show that employment and wage effects vary depending on the type of firm the worker is employed. Next, I identify the subgroups most affected by immigration by implementing a machine learning method. This method shows that firm-specific pay premiums are more important in explaining the negative effect on employment and wages than other worker characteristics. Overall, these results suggest that firms play an influential role in determining the impact of immigration on workers' outcomes.

- [Immigration, Wages, and Employment under Informal Labor Markets](https://e-archivo.uc3m.es/handle/10016/35664)
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary><p> 
  This paper studies the labor market impacts of the Venezuelan immigration in Colombia. Exploiting spatial variation in exposure, I find a negative effect on native wages driven by the informal sector (where immigrants are concentrated) and a reduction in native employment in the formal sector (where the minimum wage binds for many workers). To explain this asymmetry, I build a model in which firms substitute formal for informal labor in response to lower informal wages. Consistent with the model's predictions, I document that the increase in informality is driven by small firms that use both labor types in production.

  - Monopsony Power and Firm Organization (with [Álvaro Jáñez](https://economics.uc3m.es/personal/janez/))
    <details><summary>Abstract</summary><p> 
    Twice as many firms compete for production workers in Portuguese local labor markets than for managers. This paper studies the welfare effects of monopsony power and minimum wages in a general equilibrium model where firms organize production in hierarchies. Using administrative data, we find that monopsony power reduces production workers' and managers' welfare by 5.7% and 23.1%. Ignoring that monopsony power incentivizes managerial delegation overestimates these losses by 0.6 and 2.1 pp. Recent statutory rises in the minimum wage lower overall welfare and affect managers through worker reallocation and delegation decisions. Moving to an optimal occupation-based minimum wage leads to welfare gains of nearly 0.2% for both occupations.
