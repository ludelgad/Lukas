- [Immigration and Worker Responses Across Firms: Evidence from Administrative Records in Colombia](https://ludelgad.github.io/files/JMP_Delgado.pdf)
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary> <p> 
Many migrants are moving to developing countries where small firms are prevalent. The interaction between firms, workers, and labor supply shocks in these contexts is mainly unknown. To answer this, I exploit the mass arrival of migrants from Venezuela in Colombia and use administrative employer-employee data covering the universe of formal workers and firms to follow natives' labor market outcomes over time. After migrants arrive, I find a reduction in individual employment concentrated at the bottom of the wage distribution (among self-employed and minimum-wage earners) and in low-paying firms. Besides, I find a negative wage effect driven by workers from the upper part of the wage distribution who work in small firms. Consistent with this, I construct a model of heterogeneous firms to show that employment and wage effects vary depending on the type of firm the worker is employed. Next, I identify the subgroups most affected by immigration by implementing a machine learning method. This method shows that firm-specific pay premiums explain the negative effect on employment and wages more than other worker characteristics. Overall, these results suggest that firms play an influential role in determining the impact of immigration on workers' outcomes.

- [Immigration, Wages, and Employment under Informal Labor Markets](https://e-archivo.uc3m.es/handle/10016/35664)
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary><p> 
This paper studies the labor market impacts of the Venezuelan immigration in Colombia. Exploiting spatial variation in exposure, I find a negative effect on native wages driven by the informal sector (where immigrants are concentrated) and a reduction in native employment in the formal sector (where the minimum wage binds for many workers). To explain this, I build a model in which a firm substitutes formal for informal labor in response to lower informal wages. Consistent with the model's predictions, I document that the decrease in formal employment is driven by small firms that use both labor types in production and by workers earning the minimum wage.

- [Monopsony Power and Firm Organization](https://ajanez.github.io/files/JMP_Firm_Org.pdf) (with [Álvaro Jáñez](https://ajanez.github.io/))
    <details><summary>Abstract</summary><p> 
    Labor market competition for managers and production workers drastically differs in Portugal. Using administrative data together with a general equilibrium model where firms organize production in hierarchies, we show that the heterogeneity in monopsony power leads to a welfare loss of 5.7% for production workers and 23.1% for managers. Managers experience greater losses because often work in markets with fewer competing firms, are less mobile, and have less exposure to minimum wages. This affects the optimal design of minimum wages to alleviate monopsony power. Recent statutory raises in the minimum wage lower overall welfare. Moving to an optimal occupation-based minimum wage generates a welfare gain of 0.2% for both occupations.

- The Impact of Hard Discount Stores on Local Labor Markets: Evidence from Colombia (with Andrés Calderón & [Andrea Otero-Cortés](https://sites.google.com/view/andrea-otero-cortes/home))
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary><p> 
Hard discount stores have disrupted the traditional retail sector around the globe by offering a limited assortment of low-priced products. These stores can induce competition, increase labor demand, or generate spillovers to other sectors, yet their impact on the labor market is mainly unknown. To fill this gap, we study the impact of these stores on local labor markets in Colombia. We exploit the staggered expansion of hard discount chains across the country and combine it with administrative records and survey data to analyze the evolution of labor market outcomes in the formal and informal sectors. Our findings show that the entry of hard discount stores increases local formal employment, particularly in manufacturing and agriculture. The spillovers are thus important because most of the goods sold by hard discounters are produced in these industries. Regarding the informal sector, the increased competition among retailers does not reduce informal retail employment, albeit informal retail wages are on a negative trend. These findings have implications for policymakers and local businesses in developing countries.
