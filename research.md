- [Immigration and Worker Responses Across Firms: Evidence from Administrative Records in Colombia](https://ludelgad.github.io/files/JMP_Delgado.pdf)
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary> <p> 
Many migrants are recently moving to developing countries where the informal sector is large and small firms are prevalent in the labor market. The interaction between firms, workers, and immigration shocks in these contexts is mainly unknown. To address this, I exploit the mass arrival of migrants from Venezuela in Colombia and use administrative records covering the universe of formal workers and firms. As immigrants concentrate in the informal sector, formal employment for natives earning the minimum wage declines, reflecting their high substitutability with informal workers who become less costly. Across firms, the negative formal employment and wage effects are concentrated in small firms. To rationalize this, I construct a model of heterogeneous firms that hire formal and informal labor to show that the response is more pronounced in small firms as they hire relatively more informal labor. Finally, using causal forests, I show that the heterogeneity of employment and wage effects is explained more by firm characteristics rather than worker characteristics. These results suggest that firms are important for understanding the impact of immigration on native workers and the labor market overall.

- [Immigration, Wages, and Employment under Informal Labor Markets](https://e-archivo.uc3m.es/handle/10016/35664)
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary><p> 
This paper studies the labor market impacts of the Venezuelan immigration in Colombia. Exploiting spatial variation in exposure, I find a negative effect on native wages driven by the informal sector (where immigrants are concentrated) and a reduction in native employment in the formal sector (where the minimum wage binds for many workers). To explain this, I build a model in which a firm substitutes formal for informal labor in response to lower informal wages. Consistent with the model's predictions, I document that the decrease in formal employment is driven by small firms that use both labor types in production and by workers earning the minimum wage.

- [Monopsony Power and Firm Organization](https://ajanez.github.io/files/JMP_Firm_Org.pdf) (with [Álvaro Jáñez](https://ajanez.github.io/))
    <details><summary>Abstract</summary><p> 
Labor market competition for managers and production workers drastically differs. For instance, in Portugal, twice as many firms compete for managers as compared to production workers in the typical local labor market. Using administrative data from Portugal together with a general equilibrium model where firms organize production in hierarchies, we show that the heterogeneity in monopsony power leads to a welfare loss of 5.7% for production workers and 23.1% for managers. Managers bear greater losses because they often work in markets with fewer competing firms, are less mobile, and are less affected by minimum wages. The heterogeneity in monopsony power across both occupations affects the optimal design of minimum wages. We find that moving to an optimal occupation-based minimum wage generates a welfare gain of 0.2% for both occupations by targeting the specific monopsony power over each occupation.

- The Impact of Hard Discount Stores on Local Labor Markets: Evidence from Colombia (with Andrés Calderón & [Andrea Otero-Cortés](https://sites.google.com/view/andrea-otero-cortes/home))
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary><p> 
Hard discount stores have disrupted traditional retail worldwide by selling low-priced products, yet their impact on the labor market is under-researched. To fill this gap in the literature, we study the impact of the entry of these stores on local labor markets in Colombia. We exploit the staggered geographic expansion of the leading hard discount chains across the country and combine it with administrative records on social security and taxes and survey data to analyze the evolution of labor market outcomes in the formal and informal sectors. Our findings show that the entry of hard discounters to a municipality increases local formal employment, particularly in manufacturing and agriculture. This suggests that there are important spillovers from retail to other industries because most of the goods these stores sell are locally sourced. Regarding the informal sector, the increase in competition among formal and informal retailers does not significantly reduce informal employment in retail. Still, we find a negative trend in informal retailers' labor income, which might suggest that the margin of adjustment is via lower earnings due to a decline in profits. These findings have important implications for policymakers and local businesses in developing countries.
