- [Immigration, Wages, and Employment under Informal Labor Markets](https://e-archivo.uc3m.es/handle/10016/35664)
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary><p> 
  This paper studies the labor market impacts of the Venezuelan immigration in Colombia. Exploiting spatial variation in exposure, I find a negative effect on native wages driven by the informal sector (where immigrants are concentrated) and a reduction in native employment in the formal sector (where the minimum wage binds for many workers). To explain this asymmetry, I build a model in which firms substitute formal for informal labor in response to lower informal wages. Consistent with the model's predictions, I document that the increase in informality is driven by small firms that use both labor types in production.

- Immigration and Worker Responses Across Firms: Evidence from Administrative Records in Colombia
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary> <p> 
  This paper studies the worker-level effects of a labor supply shock and the role of firms in these effects. To do so, I exploit the mass arrival of migrants from Venezuela in Colombia and use administrative employer-employee data covering the universe of formal workers to follow natives' labor market outcomes over time. First, I find a reduction in employment concentrated at the bottom of the wage distribution (among self-employed and minimum-wage earners). Besides, I find a negative wage effect driven by workers from the upper part of the wage distribution who work in relatively small firms. Consistent with this, I construct a model of heterogeneous firms to show that employment and wage effects vary depending on the type of firm the worker is employed. Next, I identify the subgroups most affected by immigration by implementing a machine learning method. This method shows that firm-specific pay premiums are more important in explaining the negative effect on employment and wages than other worker characteristics. Overall, these results suggest that firms play an influential role in determining the impact of immigration on workers' outcomes.
