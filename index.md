I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Economics at the University of Oslo. I hold a PhD in Economics from Universidad Carlos III. I visited the Economics Department at UC Berkeley during my PhD.

I am broadly interested in labor economics and applied microeconomics. My current research centers on immigration, minimum wages, monopsony power, and the impact of local labor market shocks.
