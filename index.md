I am broadly interested in labor economics and applied microeconomics. My current research projects focus on questions related to immigration, minimum wages, monopsony power, and local labor markets. I visited the Economics Department at UC Berkeley in the Fall of 2022. I did my bachelor's and master's degree in Economics at Universidad de Los Andes in Colombia.

 - I am also a researcher at the Institute for Economic Analysis (IAE)-CSIC in Barcelona and a short-term consultant at the World Bank
 - I co-organize the [Junior Economics of Migration Seminar](https://sites.google.com/view/the-economics-of-migration)
