I am a 5th-year Ph.D. student at UC3M broadly interested in labor economics and applied microeconomics. My current research projects focus on questions related to immigration, minimum wages, and imperfect labor markets. I visited the Economics Department at UC Berkeley in the Fall of 2022. I did my bachelor's and master's degree in Economics at Universidad de Los Andes in Colombia.
