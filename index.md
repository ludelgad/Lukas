I hold a PhD in Economics from Universidad Carlos III. I will join the Department of Economics at the University of Oslo as a Postdoctoral Fellow.

I am broadly interested in labor economics and applied microeconomics. My current research projects focus on questions related to immigration, minimum wages, monopsony power, and local labor market shocks. I visited the Economics Department at UC Berkeley in the Fall of 2022.
