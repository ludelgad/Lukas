### Hello, welcome to my webpage! 
 
<p align="left" > 
I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Economics at the University of Oslo. I hold a PhD in Economics from Universidad Carlos III. I visited the Economics Department at UC Berkeley in the fall of 2022.
</p> Find here my [CV](https://ludelgad.github.io/files/Delgado_CV.pdf).

I am broadly interested in labor economics and applied microeconomics. My current research focuses on immigration, minimum wages, monopsony power, and the adjustments to local labor market shocks.
